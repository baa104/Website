<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going.

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our puposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print."

You could make this document the easy way by posting on Google Site, an Adobe Spark, a Weebly, or a Wix, or you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will also learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science...enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management.

So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?-->

 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the index.html and style.css files in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to expalin to browsers how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->
<title>Bryce Anderson's Portfolio</title>
<!--this next section of code does important work to help different browsers understand what this page should look like on the different kinds of screens.-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS file. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating to font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>

<!--The <body> of the document houses the content that a user usually sees on a website. We'll be spending most of our time in this section.-->
<body>

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.-->

<!--The hero image is controlled on the style.css page. To replace this image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it hero.jpg. Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, and change the file type from .jpg to .png. Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png imgaes. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes...improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you?

  <h2>Bio</h2>

  <p>I am a senior in the DNID major, going along the Game Design track. As you can guess, my goal is to become a game developer, and I have devoted many hours to learning the necessary skills. I have experience with the <a href=https://unity.com/>Unity game engine</a> as well as C# scripting, and I have some experience creating 3d models in <a href=https://www.blender.org>Blender</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="textblock">
  <h2>Unity Experience</h2>
  <p>I first began working with Unity around March of 2021. I started off making an AR project for a class and later decided to make a project for myself. The class project was supposed to be narrative heavy but I wanted to make something more engaging, so I got to work creating a first person shooter. It is currently February of 2022 and I have chipped away at this project ever since, teaching myself C# scripting, low poly 3d modeling, and very basic animation.</p>

<!--Show us. Find those beautiful, meaningful "family" photos and pictures of your place (only you can define family). If you are concerned about issues of privacy, you can always use stock images, or get creative. Add these photos to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace the names in the grid code below. You can add more images if you wish, or subtract...you might also need to move content around to achieve balance. See what happens – sometimes you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. Since these images are smaller, you will want to resize your images to less than 600px in width. This will improve load time and thus general accesibility. Don't forget to add alt="text"-->

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment. You can't break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->

  <h2>Bad App</h2>
  <p><a href="./BreakTime.pdf">BreakTime PDF here.</a></p>
  <p>Like many people, I feel like I spend far too much time on my phone. There have been times where I would lay down in bed to fall asleep only to keep myself up for hours watching YouTube videos. I know that having my phone on so close to my bed is causing me to stay up and that the solution is to simply shut it down and eliminate the distraction, but its just too easy to pick it up and scroll. Its not just YouTube either; I have been late to Zoom meetings in the past because I was too preoccupied scrolling through memes on Instagram. Its way too easy to open a social media app and loose track of time, so I thought it would be interesting if there was an outside force that restricted your access. My app BreakTime does this by giving you a set amount of time each day to go through your socials before locking you out.

   The app is rather simple. Either through manual user input or automatic calculations based on usage data, BreakTime generates a time limit for each of the user's social media apps. As an example, say I manually input a daily limit of 2 hours in Instagram. Every second I spend in Instagram that day is added up within BreakTime, and when I finally accumulate a grand total of 2 hours spent in Instagram, BreakTime kicks me from the app and sends me back to the home screen whenever I try to reopen it. This is reset after 18 hours, so if I reached my 2 hour limit at 5 PM, I can reopen Instagram at 11 AM.

   Originally, I intended to make the app limit how much continuous time you could spend in your socials. Since this app is meant to help you not loose track of time and fall down a rabbit hole, this made sense, but there was one main issue; it would be very easy for users to circumvent if they wanted to. If the app tracked continuous time so it could stop you when you reach the limit, you could just close and immediately reopen the app to reset the timer. This would render the app useless to people who likely need it the most. By setting it to be a daily limit, users can no longer cheat the system, and in fact are forced to be more mindful of the limited time they do spend.

   For my image, I wanted to demonstrate what BreakTime would look like in action. Rather than spend time trying to make a cool icon or fancy UI, I wanted to show readers exactly what to expect if they were to use this app: a no-nonsense reminder that their daily limit has been reached. The home screen was made using a combination of GIMP, and open source alternative to Adobe Photoshop, and Mediamodifier, a (god-awful) free online tool for creating messages from templates. The text and background was made with Canva, another free online tool that lets you create ads and other documents from templates.

   The main issue I can see this app creating is blocking access to socials in urgent situations. Whether you need to DM a friend/loved one about a family emergency or need to look up a tutorial on how to put out a fire or perform CPR, you are completely out of luck if you have already met your daily limit. Depending on circumstances, you may need to borrow someone else's phone or access your account through a browser, which takes more time and may also stall you with ads.</p>

<!--Time to process. How do you use media? What role do certain kinds of media play in your life? How does media serve a social function? In what way might you be "recreating" or "remaking" media in your everyday life?

FUN FACT: "Lorem ipsum", "Lorem ipsum" was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum," developers made it non-sensical. So while you will probably never write as well as Cicero, you can always improve upon "Lorem ipsum." -->

<!--So what exactly is your community: is it actual? virtual? Where do find your ground, or at least, where do you drop anchor, you drifter, you? While we often think of communities as neighborhoods and clubs and a group of colleagues or friends, you might find community across the frontiers of the dead, and perhaps even with those who have never lived. I'll let you explain. -->

<!-- In our final discourse section, we will process the role schooling has played in our lives. -->

    <!--To change the image for this wide screen paralax scroll, you will need change the file name in your style.css to match an image in your project folder. Look for ".paralax1" on your style.css sheet-->

<!--Like it or not, your schooling, formal and informal, for better or for worse, has been another factor that has brought you here and prepared you for this moment. Let's think through these systems, expectations, and outcomes. And let's also think a little about futurity... where is this learning, formal and informal – this unconcealing – taking you? -->

<!--The final step in our process will be to ensure that a smaller version of our "hero image," what Ulmer would refer to as our "wide image," repeats at the bottom of our document to better reinforce this motif.  -->
